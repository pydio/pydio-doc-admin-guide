In the **Enterprise Edition**, an audit log gathers all non-technical events to help focus on business logic when analysing logs for compliance or when tracing events after a security breach.

Audit Logs are accessible under the section **Dashboard** inside the **Activity** tab.

Logs are grouped using a unique Request-Id as they may be produced by a unique action going through various micro-services.

When using Supervisorctl (or systemd) service, audit logs are also available in the `~/.config/pydio/cells/logs/audit.log` file (rotated every day).

## Exporting logs

Access the audit log section from here,

For an easier analysis, audit logs can be exported in XLSX or CSV format.  
To do so, you can use the button in the top-right of the audit logs screen. Please note that you must first filter the logs (either by searching or by restricting to a given period) to avoid exporting the whole base of logs at once.
