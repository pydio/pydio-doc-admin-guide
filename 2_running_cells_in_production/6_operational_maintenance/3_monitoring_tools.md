You can monitor its resources consumption and also Cells internals like microservices.

The prerequisites to collect the metrics are the following:

- Enable metrics on Cells.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)

To enable metrics on Cells, collect them and then expose them with prometheus please refer to the knowledge base.
