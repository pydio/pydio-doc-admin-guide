Image and video annotations is a another feature that will enhance the collaborative aspect, you can now share and point to any specific part of a video/image.


## Enabling annotations

By default on the latest release (2.1.0) of Cells, image annotations are enabled by default and video annotations will require you to enable them.

### Image annotations

To use image annotations, open an image through the Cells interface (main application or public link), you can notice a button on the bottom right.

This will open up a menu, you can see that there is 3 different shapes (**circled by red dotted line on the screenshot below**).

You can select any shape (in the screenshot above you can see the 3 different kind), then a cursor will be enabled, click on anything on the image and it will draw the annotation then you can add text to it.


### Video annotations

You need to first enable the annotations, to do so (enable adavanced parameters) and browse to **Application Parameters >> Available Plugins**.

Search for **video**:
