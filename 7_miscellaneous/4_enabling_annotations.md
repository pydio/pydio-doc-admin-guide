Image and video annotations is a another feature that will enhance the collaborative aspect, you can now share and point to any specific part of a video/image.


## Enabling annotations

By default on the latest release (2.1.0) of Cells, image annotations are enabled by default and video annotations will require you to enable them.

### Image annotations

To use image annotations, open an image with the Cells interface (main application or public link) and hit the annotation menu, a button located on the bottom right.

This will open up a menu, you can notice 3 different shapes selectors (**circled by red dotted line on the screenshot below**).

You can select any shape (in the screenshot above you can see the 3 different kind), then a cursor will be enabled, click on anything on the image and it will draw the annotation then you can add text to it.


### Video annotations

You need to first enable the annotations, to do so ([enable advanced parameters](./advanced-configurations)) and browse to **Application Parameters >> Available Plugins**.

Search for **video**:

Hit the display annotation button and then **new**, you can now select any part of the timeline and put a text to indicate what it is.

Once you have added an annotation this will be the end result:
