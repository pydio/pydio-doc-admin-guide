The activity page allows you to monitor what is inside the ajxp_log table.
By default, you'll see the current day actions on the server.
You also can change the date and put search content inside the rows.

In the Enterprise Distribution, you have the ability to export the logs in CSV format for offsite archiving or analysis. Please note that this is done directly via a database
dump and currently is only working on MySQL.
