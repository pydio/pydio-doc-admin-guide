Metadata is a feature that enables the end-user to attach any kind of information to a file or a folder.

Metadata namespaces are predefined by the Admin and their value can be freely added by the end-user. Typically, a good example of predefined metadata is the ability given by the admin to the end user to _rate_ a file or a folder. Another widely used example is the _comments_ feature.

Metadata can be used to enrich files information. They are visible in the right panel that appear when a file is selected.

### Visibility Restrictions

In addition of enriching file info, metadata are use in may others part of Cells like the search engine, the security policies, the tasks scheduling and many other features. When defining a metadata the admin can choose  whether or not it is visible or editable by other everyone. The options help adjusting metadata restrictions:

| Fields                            | Description                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Index in search engine**        | When enabled adds set the metadata as search option. |
| **Restrict visibility to admins** | When enabled only admins users are able to see it    |
| **Restrict edition to admins**    | When enabled only admins users are able to edit it   |

Typically, an admin could define a "Confidential" metadata and let only people with "Admin" status have the right to edit this data. Then the value of this metadata could be used in a security policy to decide whether a document is accessible to the outside network, or outside of office hours, etc.
