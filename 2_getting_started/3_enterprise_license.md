In this section you can see and manage your license informations. Your Enterprise Distribution license is available in your Pydio.com account. Make sure to avoid adding white-space at the beginning or end of the license name / license key if you are copy/pasting the value from another page.

Providing an administrator email will allow Pydio to send you a warning email if the number of users is soon reached or if the license is about to expire.
