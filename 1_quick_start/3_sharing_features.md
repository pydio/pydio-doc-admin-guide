## Sharing with Cells

The Cells concept will be familiar to modern workers used to collaborating on _"channels"_ within popular group-chat applications. Cells can be shared internally or externally to the organization, with users able to add new individuals and groups to the Cell. In-app, instant messaging within each Cell, provides a focused channel for group communication around the theme.

End-users can create their own, flexible Cells: combining files and folders from any location, or picking users from their address book.
