> Warning:
> - This how-to is applied for Centos 7 and RHEL 7 x86_64 only.
> - This repo uses software collection, please make sure that your box is running to provide only Pydio service. It may break other services due to php version.

Pydio 7 and its dependencies require PHP version >= 5.6. However, centos 7/rhel 7 are still support PHP 5.4 as official version. That's why we have to use extra repos to pack with Pydio 7. For more information about software collection, please visit: [rh-php56](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-php56/)

## Install Software Collection, EPEL and Pydio repositories

Or `yum install pydio-all ` to install all community packages of Pydio.

### Installing Pydio Enterprise

Enterprise version requires extra repo which is reserved only for subscribed clients.

Add enterprise repo:

    rpm -Uvh https://API_KEY:API_SECRET@download.pydio.com/auth/linux/centos/6/x86_64/pydio-enterprise-release-1-1.el6.noarch.rpm

> Note: If your system runs on SSL port, *httpd24-mod_ssl* module is required.

Then edit /etc/yum.repos.d/pydio-enterprise.repo and replace API_KEY, API_SECRET by your credential.
You can get API_KEY, API_SECRET in https://pydio.com > login with your account > User account >> MY LICENSES

    [pydio-enterprise]
    name=Pydio official packages for enterprise version

    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    protect=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-PYDIO

Your box is ready for this command: `yum install pydio-enterprise` to install all enterprise packages

### Upgrading from Pydio 6.4.2

> Warning: If you've installed Pydio before, please backup your sytem or take a snapshoot before upgrade.

Update the whole system

    yum update -y

Upgrade pydio only

    yum update pydio-core pydio-enterprise

> Note: if you have issue with samba dependancies, try to execute following commands:
    rpm -e --nodeps samba4-client
    rpm -e --nodeps samba4-common


## Post install/upgrade.

This step is required to reconfigure Pydio, apache and php. Because the system now contains multiple version of apache and php, we should
do:

1. Disable default apache and php5.4
2. Enable new apache and php5.6
3. Migrate configuration of php5.4, old apache to new version

Disable default apache:

    service httpd stop
    chkconfig httpd off

Enable new apache:

    chkconfig httpd24-httpd on
    service httpd24-httpd start

Enable php56

    source /opt/rh/rh-php56/enable

Enable httpd24-http

    source /opt/rh/httpd24/enable

Now you can verify the PHP version by typing the command in terminal windows:

    [root@localhost ~]# php -v
    PHP 5.6.5 (cli) (built: Aug 30 2016 13:52:26)
    Copyright (c) 1997-2014 The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Zend Technologies
        with the ionCube PHP Loader (enabled) + Intrusion Protection from ioncube24.com (unconfigured) v6.0.5, Copyright (c) 2002-2016, by ionCube Ltd.
        with Zend OPcache v7.0.4-dev, Copyright (c) 1999-2014, by Zend Technologies

Software Collection use different location than default to deploy software base on its version. And new location for PHP56 is:

Equivalent paths between default and software collection version


|file| default version   |      Softwarecollection version      |
|-|----------|:-------------|
|php.ini| /etc/php.ini |  /etc/opt/rh/rh-php56/php.ini |
|php cli| /usr/bin/php |    /opt/rh/rh-php56/root/usr/bin/php   |
|php module configs| /usr/lib64/php/modules | /opt/rh/rh-php56/root/usr/lib64/php/modules |
|apache module configs| /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ | /opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ |
|pydio.conf| /etc/httpd/conf.d/pydio.conf | /opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d/pydio.conf |


If you upgrade from Pydio 6.4.2, and php.ini was changed, you should change such parameters in new php.ini as well: /etc/opt/rh/rh-php56/php.ini



### Update database

All sql script is store in /usr/share/doc/pydio/sql, you can execute following commands to **upgrade** your exited DB. The script for updating DB can be downloaded:
 
- [MySQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.0.mysql) 
- [Postgre](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.0.pgsql) 
- [SQLite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.0.sqlite)

For example:

    mysql -u username -p databasename < path/7.0.0.mysql
   
   Change the version number:
   
    mysql> UPDATE ajxp_version SET `db_build`="66";


### Others configurations

#### PHP.ini parameters

Following parameters should be reconfigured in /etc/opt/rh/rh-php56/php.ini (not /etc/php.ini)

Example:

    max_execution_time = 300
    post_max_size = 200M
    upload_max_filesize = 200M
    output_buffering = Off

Then restart apache

    service httpd24-httpd restart

#### MariaDB

In this how-to, we take an example of using MySQL to store all configuration of Pydio.

Install mariadb:

    yum install mariadb mariadb-server
    
Start mariadb service at boot time
 
    systemctl enable mariadb
    systemctl start mariadb
    
Run secure installation

    mysql_secure_installation

Enter mysql command line

    mysql -u root -p
    
Execute following commands to create database for pydio
    
    create database pydio;
    create user 'pydio'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
    grant all privileges on pydio.* to 'pydio'@'localhost';
    flush privileges;
