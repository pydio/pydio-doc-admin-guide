In this article we are pushing the branding to have a custom made Cells instance that suits every aspect of your company branding. You can change the logos, favicon, desktop background and much more.

### Main logo and Background image

To change the logo on the main pages, head to **Cells Console >> Application Parameters >> Appearance**.

You will be presented with the following menu:

You can also notice that the backgrounds are mentioned, while in the same **Cells Console >> Application Parameters >> Appearance** scroll down and you will see this menu.

First you can notice 2 distinct sections for both you have a set of 1 to 6 different backgrounds that are selected randomly.

- **Pydio Background Images**: which are all the backgrounds displayed on the application
- **Minisite**: those backgrounds are related to the public links for instance, (public links make use of the minisite).

> For users that would like to have the same background everywhere and do not want the random selection, make sure to put the same image on all of the different **custom background (n)** setting.

### Change the favicon

You can modify the favicon (it is the little icon on your browser tab) by heading to **Application Parameters >> Advanced Settings**.
